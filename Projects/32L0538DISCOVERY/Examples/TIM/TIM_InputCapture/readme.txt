@par Example Description 

Use of the TIM peripheral to measure an external signal frequency.
  
  The TIM2CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
  counter clock is SystemCoreClock (Hz).
  SystemCoreClock is set to 32 MHz for STM32L0xx Devices.

  TIM1 is configured in Input Capture Mode: the external signal is connected to 
  TIM1 Channel2 used as input pin.
  To measure the frequency we use the TIM1 CC2 interrupt request, so in the 
  TIM1_CC_IRQHandler routine, the frequency of the external signal is computed.
  
  The "uwFrequency" variable contains the external signal frequency:
  uwFrequency = TIM1 counter clock / uwDiffCapture (Hz),
  where "uwDiffCapture" is the difference between two consecutive TIM1 captures.

The minimum frequency value that can be measured is (TIM2 counter clock / CCR MAX)
                                         = 32.000.000/ 65535
                                         = 489 Hz
                                         
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L053xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L0538-DISCO RevB  board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
   
  - Connect the external signal to be measured to TIM2_CH2 pin (PB.03).


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
