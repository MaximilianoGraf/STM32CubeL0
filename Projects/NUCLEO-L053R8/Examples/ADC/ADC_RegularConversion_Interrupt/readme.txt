@par Example Description 

How to use the ADC in interrupt mode to convert data through the HAL API.
  
The ADC is configured to continuously convert channel0, resolution is set to 12
bit right alignment with a software start.
Each time an end of conversion occurs an interrupt is generated and the converted 
data of ADC1 DR register is affected to the uwADCxConvertedValue variable in the 
ADC conversion complete call back function.

In order to reduce power consumption, the low frequency mode is enabled since
the ADC clock is PCLK clock (this mode can be enabled only if ADC clock is lower
than 2.8MHz), combined with AutoWait feature (new conversion is started only
when previous conversion is completed).
  
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32L051xx, STM32L052xx, STM32L053xx STM32L062xx and 
    STM32L063xx device lines RevZ
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32L053R8-Nucleo RevC  board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - Connect an external signal to PA.0 (A0 Arduino connector).
  - To monitor the conversion result, put uwADCxConvertedValue in the live watch.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
